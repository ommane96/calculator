🧮 Continuous Calculator
A simple command-line Python calculator that performs continuous arithmetic operations until the user chooses to exit. It's beginner-friendly and designed to demonstrate core programming concepts like functions, loops, conditional statements, and error handling.

🚀 Features
Perform basic arithmetic operations:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division (with zero-division handling)

Continuous operation in a loop

Input validation for numeric values

User-friendly and minimalistic terminal interface
